# Neural Conversation Spanish
A neural conversation model implementation in Spanish built with Tensor Flow

Based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869) this model uses movie subtitles in Spanish from www.opensubtitles.org 
as well a pre-trained word vectors from [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText)
to train a LSTM network in TensorFlow to achieve a conversation agent.
